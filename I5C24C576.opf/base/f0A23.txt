The householder Bhadrapāla heard that the mendicant Gautama, who had renounced the Śākya clan and become an ascetic, was 
travelling in Magadha together with a great community of mendicants, 1,250 strong, that he had arrived at the great city
of Rājagṛha, and that he was now staying on Vulture's Peak, near the city, and that he was being greeted with elegant a
nd generous words of praise:"Such indeed is the Blessed One: He has reached truth, he is worthy of offerings, a fully ac
complished Buddha, perfect in wisdom and conduct, he has reached bliss, he is a knower of the world, an unsurpassable gu
ide for those who wish to train, a teacher of gods and men, awakened, and blessed.He teaches the true Dharma, he reveals
the holy life, excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle, and excellent in the end, accurate in meaning and w
ell expressed, simple, complete, genuine and pure."

He thought to himself: "Now I should really go to see the ascetic Gautama.It is wonderful to have the opportunity to see 
those who have reached truth and are worthy of offerings, who are fully accomplished buddhas."So it was that the merchan

graceful and pleasant manner, with his senses composed and his mind at ease, supremely disciplined and tranquil.His sens
es subdued, with the dignity of an elephant,he was clear and shining like a lake of pure water.He was honored by a great
many gods, honored by a great many yakṣas, honored by a great many men.His body was golden, with the thirty-two marks o
f a great being, and adorned with the eighty secondary characteristics.A great rain of flowers, a great flood of flowers
, rained down upon him, and so he walked among a thousand billion lotus petals made of the seven kinds of jewels.When th
ey saw him approaching in the distance with this display of many hundreds of thousands of forms of pure conduct, they we
re filled with faith in the Blessed One.Their minds filled with faith, they approached the Blessed One, venerated him by
placing their heads at his feet,and sat down at one side.Then the householder Bhadrapāla, accompanied by the other 500 
householders, spoke to the Blessed One:
