I had heard about the glory, fame,and splendour of the body of the Victorious One,but you are even more sublime in person
,like an image in gold.Your body is graceful and beautiful.Because of your exalted, golden formyou shine among the monks
like the moon among the stars.Never before have I seen the crown of the head of the greatest among men,but now I see it 
rising up like Mount Meru,like the parasol of the gods,a sign that you have attained the highest degree of transformatio
n.I see the hair on your head, delicate and supple,shining like a dark sapphire.Its soft curls twist to the rightJust li
ke the neck of a peacock.The best of speakers has a smooth forehead,your eyebrows shaped like rainbows.Between your eyeb
rows shines a perfect curl of hairblazing like the king of stars.Your eyes are exquisite, and delight all who look upon 
them.They are beautiful, beloved by those who gaze upon them.Merely observing is not enough for me,I salute the protecto
r with immaculate eyes.The nose of the best of menis as magnificent as a golden horn,his lips coral-red like the fruit o
f the ivy gourd,exceedingly pure like a precious jewel.Your shining teeth are perfectly white,like lotus-root, cow’s mil
k, or a crane.Firm, whole, well set, supremely pure,your teeth are an ornament to joyous discipline.The Victorious One's
teeth are well-spaced,the canine teeth shining spotlessly,like the king of the geese, flying first in formation,whiter 
than white, and completely pure.Like a pure red lotus, the color of copper,red like the rising sun, the color of a pure 
jewel,the Sugata’s tongue is delicate and smooth,and so long and broad that it can cover his face.I have truly never see
n or heard of anythingin the brahma-world, or in any human or divine realm,like the exquisite ears of Gautama.He has the
jaws and the courage of a lion.By the power of the blissful one, I see his neck,his pure and resplendent throat, extrac
ting the subtle essence of flavors,straight, not crooked, and centrally positioned.His sense of taste is unrivalled, lik
e that of the god of gods and men.You are broad-chested, and your shoulder blades are round.Your seven supreme limbs are
famed throughout the world.Blazing with the highest glory, the archetypal king,you are like the sun rising over the pea
k of the mountain.There are protrubrances on the soles of both of your feet,on both of your hands, and on both shoulders
,and one protrubrance on the back of your neck.The fullness of your beauty is pure and radiant.The arms of the Blessed O
ne Gautama hang down,like the trunk of the lord of elephants.With both of your hands, you are ableto touch your knees wi
thout bending down.His mighty chest is like that of a lion.Broad, like the trunk of a banyan tree,his sturdy body is as 
strong and firm as that of Nārāyāṇa,With the strength that comes from forbearance.The hairs on his upper body curl to th
e right.They grow separately, and are very soft.They are unaffected by dust and smoke,just like lotuses in muddy water.Y
our male organ is said to be retracted in its sheathlike that of an excellent, well-trained horse.Your well-rounded thig
hs are like the cores of bamboo.Your calves are well-formed, with the correct proportions.You have flat insteps and broa
d heels.Your hands and feet are finely webbed.Your long, smooth fingers and toes number twenty,with copper colored nails
, like flowers.The symbol of the supreme thousand-spoked wheelshines from the soles of your feet.You do not put your fee
t down hard when you walk on the road. 1You stride lightly on the earth.You tread softly, lifting your feet four inches 
above groundas you walk, O best of men!Jeweled lotuses spring forthwherever you set your feet. How extraordinary!You adv
ance unopposed, undaunted, repelling your enemies,like an elephant, like a tiger, like the lord of the gods.You walk lik
e nothing less than a hero.Imperturbable, you stride elegantly.Superhuman beings shower you, lord, with divine flowers.I
n the sky, they venerate youwith the sounds of singing.Such magical displays are truly wondrous.Your beauty surpasses th
at of Vaiśramaṇa,your splendor is like that of a hundred suns.In the world of brahmans, of gods and men,you have no equa
l. Truly, how could anyone be superior?Having now seen this incredible miracle,I am filled with curiosity.What are the s
uperior qualities you have seen,lord of men, that made you renounce ordinary life?The Blessed One then said this to the 
merchant and householder Bhadrapāla:“Alas! One who is involved with the world is tormented by the ten afflictions.What a
re these ten afflictions?They are the affliction of birth,

the affliction of old age,

the affliction of disease,

the affliction of death,

the affliction of sorrow,

the affliction of lamentation,

the affliction of suffering,

the affliction of depression,

the affliction of grief,

and the affliction of cyclic existence.

Householder, when I saw that one who is involved with the world is tormented by these ten afflictions, I decided to attai
n unsurpassed perfect awakening, and with that conviction I left ordinary household life behind and became a renunciant.
