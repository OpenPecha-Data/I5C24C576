What, then, is the bodhisatva’s perfection of meditation, by which bodhisatvas, great beings strive to practice the way o
f the bodhisatva?

Śāriputra, the bodhisatva has left desires behind. He has left evil, unwholesome qualities behind, and attains and abides
in the first dhyāna, the state of joy and happiness that is born from aloofness, and that includes conceptualization an
d deliberation.

Then, Śāriputra, the bodhisatva, having stilled conceptualization and deliberation, with a mind which has calmed itself a
nd become focused, attains and abides in the second dhyāna, the state of joy and happiness that is born from concentrati
on, and that is without conceptualization or deliberation.

Then, Śāriputra, the bodhisatva abides in equanimity because he is not attached to joy, and with mindfulness and thoughtf
ulness experiences happiness in his body. This is how the noble ones see it. He attains and abides in the third dhyāna, 
with equanimity and mindfulness, abiding in happiness, without joy.

Then, Śāriputra, the bodhisatva, having rid himself of happiness, and of suffering, and having already put an end to posi
tivity and negativity of mind, attains and abides in the fourth dhyāna, free from suffering and happiness, and with comp
letely pure equanimity and mindfulness.

In this way, he practices meditation, and does not abandon the concentrated, completely pure, completely cleansed, unblem
ished state of meditative concentration where the secondary vices are absent.

What, then, is the bodhisatva’s practice of meditation? It is the practice of superior abilities and knowledge which he a
ccomplishes.
